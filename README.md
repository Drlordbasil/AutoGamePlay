# Videogame AI Player

This Python project aims to create a simple videogame where the player, controlled by an AI algorithm, attempts to avoid colliding with enemy objects. The game plays itself, with the AI controlling the player's movement and the enemies moving randomly. The objective is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score.

## Features

- Self-playing videogame with AI-controlled player and random-moving enemies.
- Collision detection between the player and enemies.
- Continuous gameplay until collision occurs.
- Score tracking.

## Business Plan

### Target Audience

The target audience for this videogame AI player project includes game developers, AI enthusiasts, and individuals interested in learning AI algorithms and game development.

### Monetization

Possible monetization strategies for this project may include:

1. In-app purchases: Offering additional features, power-ups, or customizations for users to enhance their gameplay experience.
2. Advertisements: Integrating advertisement banners or video ads within the game screen during gameplay.
3. Premium version: Offering a premium version of the game with extra features, levels, or enhanced graphics for a one-time fee.
4. Sponsorships: Collaborating with game development companies or AI-related organizations to sponsor the project in exchange for visibility or promotion.

### Competitor Analysis

Although self-playing videogames already exist, the specific combination of an AI-controlled player and randomly moving enemies provides a unique game dynamic. However, it is essential to differentiate this project from potential competitors by improving the AI algorithm's efficiency and incorporating innovative features.

### Project Roadmap

1. Implement the basic game structure, including the `Game`, `GameObject`, `Player`, and `Enemy` classes.
2. Build the game setup, where the player is initialized and a set number of enemies are randomly positioned.
3. Create the game loop, allowing for continuous gameplay until a collision between the player and an enemy occurs.
4. Implement the collision detection mechanism to end the game when a collision happens.
5. Add the scoring functionality to track the player's score during gameplay.
6. Improve the AI algorithm by optimizing player movement, making it smarter and more challenging for the player.
7. Enhance the game's visuals and add sound effects to improve the overall user experience.
8. Test the game thoroughly, fixing any bugs or issues that may arise during testing.
9. Document the project, including the README and any additional documentation necessary for users to understand and utilize the project.

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your machine if you haven't already (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download or clone the project repository from <repo_link>.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to execute the program:

```
python game.py
```

5. Observe the game as the AI-controlled player moves randomly and attempts to avoid collisions with the enemies.
6. The game will continue until the player collides with an enemy, at which point the game will display the final score and exit.

## Conclusion

The Videogame AI Player project provides a unique combination of AI-controlled gameplay and self-playing videogames. By implementing an efficient AI algorithm and incorporating innovative features, this project has the potential to captivate game developers, AI enthusiasts, and individuals interested in learning about game development and AI algorithms.
